### 2025-07-23 â€“ Fix `ModuleNotFoundError` in pytest

**Problem:** `pytest` was unable to find modules in the `src` directory, resulting in `ModuleNotFoundError` when collecting tests.

**Fix:** 
1.  Modified all relative imports in the `src` directory to be absolute from the `src` root.
2.  Created a `pytest.ini` file in the project root with `pythonpath = src` to inform `pytest` of the `src` directory's location.

**Files affected:**
- `src/visualization/dashboard_logic.py`
- `src/data_processing/data_cleaner.py`
- `src/data_access/property_repository.py`
- `pytest.ini` (created)

**Notes:** This change makes the project structure more robust and ensures that tests can be run from any directory.
