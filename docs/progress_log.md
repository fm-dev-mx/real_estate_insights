# Project Progress Log

This document chronologically details the actions taken, problems encountered, and solutions implemented during the development of the inventory extraction script.

## Action and Problem History

### 2025-07-20 (Project Start)

*   **Action:** Migration of the inventory download script from PowerShell to Python.
*   **Problem:** The original PowerShell script was incompatible with the complexity of the web portal (CSRF, JavaScript).
*   **Solution:** Initial implementation with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` (failed).

### 2025-07-20 (Transition to Selenium)

*   **Action:** Decision to migrate to Selenium for handling dynamic web portal interaction.
*   **Problem:** Failures in finding elements or logging in (`TimeoutException`, `ElementNotInteractableException`).
*   **Solution:** Implementation of explicit waits, adjustment of URLs and XPath selectors, use of screenshots for debugging.

### 2025-07-20 (Credential Management and Debugging)

*   **Action:** Diagnosis and resolution of issues with reading environment variables for credentials.
*   **Problem:** The script did not correctly read `C21_USERNAME` and `C21_PASSWORD` environment variables.
*   **Solution:** Script adjusted to read `C21_PASSWORD` (formerly `C21_PSW`) and mask password output. Implementation of detailed logs and screenshots at each step.

### 2025-07-20 (Interaction with Download Submenu)

*   **Action:** Adaptation of the script to interact with the download submenu.
*   **Problem:** The XLS file was not downloading due to the existence of a submenu with the download option.
*   **Solution:** Implementation of an additional click on the "Download Inventory" option within the submenu.

### 2025-07-20 (Refactoring and Optimization)

*   **Action:** Code refactoring to improve structure, readability, and robustness.
*   **Problem:** Initial code had areas for improvement in organization and efficiency.
*   **Solution:** Centralization of configuration, encapsulation of logic into functions, removal of redundant code, and optimization of waits.

### 2025-07-20 (UI/UX Improvement and Final Cleanup)

*   **Action:** Optimization of console output and dependency cleanup.
*   **Problem:** Verbose console output and unnecessary dependencies.
*   **Solution:** Concise log format for console, removal of `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` from `requirements.txt`.

### 2025-07-20 (Logging Configuration Correction)

*   **Action:** Correction of a `TypeError` in the `StreamHandler` logging configuration.
*   **Problem:** `StreamHandler` did not directly accept the `format` argument, causing an execution error.
*   **Solution:** Use of explicit `Formatter` for the `StreamHandler`.

### 2025-07-20 (Project Adaptation for n8n Automation)

*   **Action:** Project restructuring to align with the goal of building a comprehensive n8n automation.
*   **Problem:** The initial project structure did not support the long-term vision of the automation.
*   **Solution:** Establishment of a modular and scalable structure (`src/data_collection/`) for future automation stages.

## Current Project Status

The inventory data collection script is now fully functional, automating the download of property inventory from a real estate portal. It has been optimized, refactored, and adheres to best coding practices. All development and debugging tasks have been completed. The project has been adapted to serve as the foundation for an n8n automation, featuring a modular structure for future expansions.
